    "In this document I'll show a python implementation of *stacked generalization* (or *stacking*), an ensemble technique introduced in [Wolpert, David H., 1992. Stacked generalization, Neural Networks, Volume 5, Issue 2, Pages 241-259].\n",
    "Stacking uses cross validation to combine the results of several predictive models to improve their accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "A particular case of stacked generalization (*blending*) was used by the winners of the Netflix Prize (http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BigChaos.pdf). Ensemble techniques are also extremely popular in several other competitions like the ones hosted on Kaggle. More important, these methods usually perform very well also on \"real world\" predictive modeling tasks. Stacked generalization is particularly effective when we have datasets describing different aspects of the \"thing\" we are trying to predict (eg. a dataset of patients' signals). [Olivetti et. at. 2014. MEG Decoding Across Subjects](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4175) - [and a related Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/decoding-the-human-brain) - is an example of using stacking to build a robust predictor across subjects.

    "In its original formulation, the method works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Split a dataset set into two disjoint sets (train/test).\n",
    "2. Train and test $k$ models, with *cross validation*, on the first part. These are called **level-0 models**\n",
    "3. Build train and test **level-1 datasets**, using the predictions from 2) as inputs\n",
    "4. Train a higher level model (**level-1 model**) on the **level 1 data** from 3) and use it to predict unseen instances from the test set in 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complement to Wolpert's work is [Ting, Witten 1998. Issues in Stacked Generalization http://arxiv.org/pdf/1105.5466.pdf]; this paper presents empirical results that fill in on what Wolpert described as \"black art\". These can be considered a sort of \"best practices\" for stacking. In particular:\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression performs well as the level-1 model\n",
    "2. For classification tasks, build level-1 data using class probabilities rather than the predicted class labels.\n",
    "3. Like any ensemble method, stacking is ideal for parallel computation\n",
    "4. Stacking can work well with just two or three level-0 models\n",

    "In terms of potential pitfalls, the common issue with loss of interpretability in model ensembles comes to mind. [Perlich, Swirszcz 2010](http://www.sigkdd.org/sites/default/files/issues/12-2-2010-12/v12-02-4-UR-Perlich.pdf) suggest tha cross validation and stacking should be handled with care (eg. use stratified k-fold to improve robustness) when the dataset is skewed (eg. very small number of positive examples).
